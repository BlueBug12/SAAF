SAAF Demonstration: Schwefel function
=====================================

Description
===========
The Schwefel function is a well-known test function fot optimization. It has several local minima, and its global minima is
located at (420.9687,...,420.9687). In this example, I use 10-dimension Schweful function to test. Try different combinations
of parameters to find the global minima.


Execution
=========

::

  make  
  make run
